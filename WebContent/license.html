If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a

patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this 
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is

in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by 
the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices 
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to 
the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution 
notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may 
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, 
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such 
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and 
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in 
this License. 

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the 
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to 
in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including 
any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability 
to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other 
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of 
the possibility of such damages. 

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work 
or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
